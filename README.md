### A friend shared an interesting article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Commuter_flights

I looked at the data at it seemed cool.
I thought: "Hmm but I would like to see this plotted". So, a nice opportunity to try the famous `Streamlit` library :)

Instructions to run:

- Clone this repo and open it on your favourite IDE
- (Optional but always recommended) Create a venv and activate it
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `streamlit run main.py` on your terminal

A browser tab should have opened, that's it
